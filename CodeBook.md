##Features description  
**Final data set (final_set.txt) presents mean of each variable grouped by subjects and activities the subjects were performing**  
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.  
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
"f" indicates data to which Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied, producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.

###The set of variables that were estimated from these signals and are preserved in the final_set are: 

* mean(): Mean value  
* std(): Standard deviation  

**Variables are 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz**  
**Variables were normalized and bounded within [-1,1]**  

##List of variables in final_set.txt:

"activity_type" - one of six differen activities:  
1. WALKING  
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
4. SITTING  
5. STANDING  
6. LAYING
